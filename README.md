# University of Thessaly, ECE 327 VLSI Subject

VLSI course of University of Thessaly 2021. 
In this course, we implemented gates and decoders using Magic VLSI tool and simulating them with ngspice 

1st assignment : Build an CMOS TSMC 0.25 inverter and simulate it
2nd assignment : DC analysis on NMOS and PMOS transistors
3rd assignment : Implement binary functions as standard cells and simulate them
4th assignment : Calculate setup and hold in NMOS and PMOS transistors
5th assignment : Implement and simulate : A) 3x8 Decoder
                                          B) NOR ROM
